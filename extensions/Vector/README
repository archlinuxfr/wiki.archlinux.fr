The Vector extension has been discontinued and most of its
functionality was moved into MediaWiki core. If you see this file,
you should remove the extension from your MediaWiki installation.

It used to provide enhancements to the Vector skin, some experimental,
some well-established. The good parts have been integrated and the
failed experiments were removed.
